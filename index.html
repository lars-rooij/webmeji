<!-- as you can see! nothing needs to be added to the html for it to work!! yay ^-^ other than refering to the css and js ofc-->

<h1> Webmeji ৻(  •̀ ᗜ •́  ৻) </h1>
<p> Hi! the beloved desktop pet <a href="https://kilkakon.com/shimeji">shimeji</a> can now, instead of being only visible on the client side, be shown to everyone that visits your website! 

This version currently can do the following actions randomly:
<ul>
<li>Walk around on the bottom of your page! </li>
<li>Sit down for a random period! </li>
<li>Do a little silly dance! </li>
<li>Turn around! </li>
<li>And trip over itself! </li>
</ul>

Unlike the original shimeji, webmeji cannot (yet o.o): multiply, jump, climb, or get interacted with by the mouse. <p>

<p>You can: give a different appearence to the shimeji by replacing its frames, or add whole new animations and whatnot youself by changing the code! </p>

<p> Play around with the frequency of actions, frames, speeds, whatever! make your website a bit more fun by giving it its own webmeji ^-^ </p>

<p> Get the files to put webmeji on YOUR website <a href="https://github.com/lars-rooij/webmeji">HERE</a>, and find frames of your special character online to make them walk around for EVERYONE to see!!!</p>
